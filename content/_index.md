Welcome to my homepage. 

The main purpose of this page is to give me a space to write down some things that I learned about Data Science, Python, Apache Spark, etc. during my work - kind of a public notebook.

If you learn something about me and my work, or I can help you solve your problems faster using my notes... That would be even better.
